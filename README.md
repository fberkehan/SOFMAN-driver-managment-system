This driving management system helps companies to comply with EU driver tracking laws and improve safety by recording and monitoring driving data such as driver name, vehicle plate, starting and ending locations, and more. The system also provides valuable insights and analysis to optimize fleet operations and reduce risks.


This is a web-based driving management system built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system is designed to manage and keep track of the drivers and vehicles in a company. It allows drivers to log their trips with information such as starting location, ending location, starting and ending kilometers, and trip description. The information can be updated and viewed by authorized personnel in the company. The system uses a database to store all the information and provides a user-friendly interface for the drivers and personnel to use. The system is designed to be mobile-responsive and accessible from any device with an internet connection. The project was developed with the aim of improving efficiency and transparency in the management of driving activities in the company. It has been thoroughly tested and optimized for reliability and performance, making it a reliable solution for any company looking to streamline their driving management process. The driving management system that we have recently built is a comprehensive solution to monitor and manage the driving activity of the fleet of vehicles in compliance with the regulations of the European Union. The system tracks the movements of vehicles in real-time using GPS technology and provides important information such as the start and end location of the journey, the distance covered, and the duration of the trip.  One of the primary regulations of the European Union regarding the tracking of vehicles is the requirement to keep a record of working hours for professional drivers. This regulation ensures that drivers do not exceed the maximum working hours and take the necessary rest periods as mandated by law. Our driving management system automatically records the working hours of drivers and generates reports that can be used to comply with this regulation.  In addition to complying with regulations, our driving management system also provides numerous benefits for the organizations using it. The real-time tracking of vehicles helps in optimizing the route, reducing fuel consumption and maintenance costs, and improving the overall efficiency of the fleet. The system also helps in preventing theft and unauthorized use of vehicles, as well as in improving the safety of drivers and passengers.  In conclusion, the driving management system that we have built is a highly useful tool for organizations with a fleet of vehicles. The system is designed to comply with the regulations of the European Union, and its real-time tracking and reporting capabilities help in optimizing the operation of the fleet, reducing costs, and improving the safety of drivers and passengers.
